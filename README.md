# Server_PDS_Project

This repository contains the code for the project of Programmazione di Sistema at PoliTO 2017.

The server has to retrieve the list of the windows, their icons when available, and send all the information to the client.

Overall, this is mostly a synchronization exercise using C++ mutex and condition variables.
